Header Files
	hold #defines, typedefs, structs, unions ... stuff you want to use in your code, but don't want to clutter your code up defining
	can include other headers and libraries in a header file


#define <name> <value>
	by convention, things you define are all caps
	(and your var/func names are never all caps)


#ifndef _NAME_H
#define _NAME_H

... actual stuff ...
