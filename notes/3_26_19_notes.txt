Process
	OS abstraction for running code

	address space - memory segment allocated to the Proc
	.. also ... a PCB is allocated in OS space
	Process Control Block
		holds OS metadata about your Proc like
		PID - Process IDentifier
		PPID - Parent Process IDentifier
		open file descriptors
		signal disposition


	fork() ... called once, returns twice (to parent & to child)
		returns child's PID to parent
		returns 0 to child

	exec() ... called once in child, but does not return (in normal operation)
		


int pid = fork()

if (pid == 0) {
	// do child stuff
}

else if (pid < 0) {
	//oh noes!!
}
else {
	// do parent stuff
}

exec("./a.out")



int pid = fork();

if (pid == 0) {
	exec("./a.out");
