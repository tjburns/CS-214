Files:
HDDs can only read or write disk blocks
- how to have > 1 disk block 'files' ... use multiple "consecutive" blocks
.. where to store 'file' metadata .. on the HDD itself (only memory that is large enough and persistent)
.. need to have metadata about the file metadata ... so put data about inodes in the superblock


HDD areas:
user data: disk blocks that hold user data
inode: disk blocks that hold inodes (file metadata)
super: disk blocks that hold information about inodes (metametadata)
boot: disk blocks that hold basic drive, OS, and superblock info (metametametadata)

less, more, cat

grep

>	redirect ouput to a file (will create file or replace it if it already exists)
>>	append output to a file (will put data at end of file if it already exists, else it will create it)
