Networking:
ISO OSI:


Layers

Application - the program/user
Presentation - understand message format, and manipulates it to be useful to next layer 	(en/decryption, en/decompression ...)
Session - understands message content, and either manipulates it between messages or between sockets 	(connections)
Transport - message transport over network 	(sockets)
Net (Networking) - route traffic to provide a link between machines that are not directly connected 	(routers)
DL (Data Link) - manages a point-to-point link to a machine you are directly connected to 	(switches)
PHY (Physical) - info (bits) to radiation and vv

Routing ... how do routers build their routes?
IP address - network layer
DL address - MAC (Medium Access Control)
CIDR:
Network/IP Addr	Data Link/MAC Addr
123.23.5.1/24	F2:44:12:A4:E2:88
4.1.5.12/12	F2:34:12:C4:E2:85
23.124.51.2/32	3D:14:12:E4:E2:88


DNS - Domain Name Service
convert from names to IP addresses...
hierarchical:

top-level/root (edu, com, org, gov ...)
authoritative (organizational: att, rutgers, whitehouse)
non-authorititative (local caching in the network, often provides subdomains)
local (your cached lookups on your machine)


localhost ---> 127.0.0.1
mean 'this' machine
